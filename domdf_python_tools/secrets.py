class Secret(str):
	"""
	Subclass of :py:class:`str` that guards against accidentally printing a secret to the terminal.

	The actual value of the secret is accessed via the ``.value`` attribute.

	The protection should be maintained even when the secret is in a list, tuple, set or dict,
	but you should still refrain from printing objects containing the secret.

	The secret overrides the :meth:`~.__eq__` method of :class:`str`, so:

		.. code-block:: python

			>>> Secret("Barry as FLUFL") == "Barry as FLUFL"
			True
